# Workshops & Learning Resources

**NextChain Hub Ethiopia | CATS 2026**

---

## Learning Approach

Learning at NextChain Hub Ethiopia was structured around **repeated exposure, local accessibility, and practical relevance**.

Rather than relying on a single hackathon moment, we designed learning as a continuous process combining:

- In-person university workshops
    
- Virtual sessions with broader reach
    
- Self-paced learning resources for beginners
    

This approach acknowledged that many participants were new to Web3 and required sustained guidance to move from interest to implementation.

## In-Person University Workshops

Our in-person workshops formed the backbone of the hub’s learning journey.

- **November 5 & November 8:** Introductory university workshops explaining CATS 2026, hackathon structure, learning expectations, and team participation.
    
- **Post-AfroChain (nearly 2 weeks):** Continuous university-based sessions engaging developers almost daily.
    

These workshops allowed us to:

- Explain Cardano and Web3 concepts in context
    
- Build trust through face-to-face interaction
    
- Support organic team formation
    
- Identify skill gaps early and respond accordingly
    

Typical attendance ranged between **15–20 developers per session**, with strong engagement and follow-up.

## Virtual Sessions

To extend learning beyond physical locations, we hosted three virtual meetups:

- **Nov 20 & Nov 25** via Cardano Academy channels
    
- **Dec 15** via the NextChain Telegram community
    

Virtual sessions helped reach developers outside university settings and reinforced concepts introduced during in-person workshops.

## Local-Language Learning Resources

Recognising language as a barrier for many beginners, we intentionally shared **Amharic-language Cardano development resources**, including curated YouTube playlists from Cardano Academy.

These resources enabled:

- Self-paced learning
    
- Reinforcement of workshop content
    
- Accessibility for first-time blockchain developers

## Shared Learning Materials

All workshop materials, recordings, references, and shared resources are consolidated in a central repository to support continued learning and team progress.

## What We Learned

This phase reinforced several insights:

- Repetition matters more than intensity
    
- Physical presence accelerates learning and collaboration
    
- Beginner-friendly resources are essential for inclusion
    
- Technical mentorship is a critical success factor
    

These learnings directly informed how we support teams and request deeper technical assistance going forward.
