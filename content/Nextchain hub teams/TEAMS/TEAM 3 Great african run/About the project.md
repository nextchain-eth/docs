## Problem Context

Across Ethiopia and Africa, athletic achievements are often recorded in fragmented, offline, or trust-based systems. Athlete histories, race results, and recognitions are difficult to verify, preserve, or share beyond individual events.

---

## Project Vision

The Great African Run envisions a **verifiable, transparent, and inclusive athletic ecosystem**, where athletes own their performance history and African athletic excellence gains global visibility.

---

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano is used as a **trust layer** to enable:

- Verifiable athlete identities
    
- Immutable event and performance records
    
- Transparent recognition and rewards
    
- Sustainable, low-cost infrastructure suitable for Africa

## Why This Matters

Ethiopia is globally known for producing elite long-distance runners, yet lacks unified digital infrastructure to preserve and verify this legacy.  
**The Great African Run** bridges tradition and technology using Cardano to support fairness, trust, and long-term value in African athletics.
