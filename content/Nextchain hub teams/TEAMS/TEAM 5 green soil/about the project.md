# 🌱 GreenSoil

**NextChain Hub – CATS Hackathon Team Story**

## Team Overview

**GreenSoil** is a sustainable agriculture project focused on improving soil health and crop productivity through **liquid natural fertilizer**, designed specifically for small to medium-scale farmers.

The project addresses soil degradation, rising input costs, and environmental damage caused by synthetic fertilizers. By combining eco-friendly agricultural practices with **Cardano-based traceability**, GreenSoil introduces transparency, trust, and long-term sustainability into agricultural input systems.

## Problem Context

Many farmers in Ethiopia rely heavily on synthetic fertilizers, which degrade soil health, harm beneficial microorganisms, and increase long-term costs. Sustainable alternatives exist but often lack trust, visibility, and consistent adoption.

This creates a cycle of declining soil fertility, environmental damage, and reduced agricultural resilience.

---

## Project Vision

GreenSoil envisions a **sustainable, farmer-centered agricultural system** where natural inputs restore soil health, improve yields, and support long-term food security—while remaining affordable and practical for smallholder farmers.

---

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano provides a **transparent and trusted digital layer** for the project by enabling:

- Traceability of fertilizer production and distribution
    
- Verifiable records of sustainable farming inputs
    
- Trusted data for cooperatives and partners
    
- Scalable, low-cost infrastructure suitable for rural contexts
    

This aligns with Cardano’s focus on **sustainability, real-world impact, and resilient systems**.
