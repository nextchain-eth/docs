**NextChain Hub Ethiopia | CATS 2026**

## From Learning to Formation

As learning deepened through repeated workshops and virtual sessions, participants began forming teams organically. Unlike pre-assigned grouping, team formation at NextChain Hub Ethiopia emerged primarily through **in-person university workshops**, where developers could collaborate, test ideas, and assess complementary skills in real time.

This process ensured that teams were built around:

- Shared motivation
    
- Local relevance
    
- Practical feasibility
    

rather than abstract problem statements or forced matchmaking.

## Team Formation Patterns

Several clear patterns emerged during this phase:

- **Most teams formed during in-person sessions**, not virtual meetups
    
- Teams typically included a mix of students and early-career developers
    
- Roles were assigned pragmatically based on available skills, not titles
    
- Project ideas were closely tied to lived local challenges
    

To support inclusion, we collected team information through **in-person check-ins and follow-up email submissions**, ensuring no active participants were excluded due to tooling or access barriers.

## Projects & Focus Areas

The projects that emerged reflect a strong connection to local and regional needs, including:

- Web3-enabled education and credentialing
    
- Digital trust and verification systems
    
- Sustainable agriculture and green finance
    
- Ticketing, identity, and community infrastructure
    

Each project was shaped iteratively, with teams encouraged to submit early versions and continue refining after submission.

## Constraints & System Insights

While motivation and contextual grounding were strong, a key constraint surfaced consistently: **technical capacity**.

Many participants were:

- First-time Web3 builders
    
- New to Cardano tooling and architecture
    
- In need of hands-on technical mentorship
    

This insight was critical. It shifted our organising focus from team formation alone toward securing **deeper technical assistance**, structured reviews, and mentorship support through coordination with the wider CATS and WADA ecosystem.

Rather than viewing this as a failure, we treated it as a **system signal** — an indicator of where ecosystem investment and support would generate the greatest impact.

## In-Person Hackathon Convergence

To reinforce collaboration and refinement, we organised an **in-person hackathon day on Dec 20** at The Hubbits Workspace.

This gathering served as:

- A space for teams to meet beyond university settings
    
- A refinement checkpoint for early submissions
    
- A coordination moment for both in-person and virtual hackers
    

The emphasis was not competition, but alignment, learning, and progress visibility.

## What Emerged Overall

Through this process, NextChain Hub Ethiopia demonstrated:

- Strong developer interest and engagement
    
- Effective team formation through physical presence
    
- Clear demand for sustained technical mentorship
    
- A viable pathway from learning → formation → early implementation
    

These outcomes now inform how the hub continues to support teams and contribute to the broader CATS 2026 journey.
