## Cardano Alignment

Cardano serves as the **trust and incentive layer** for Yeneta Academy by enabling:

- **Verifiable credentials:** On-chain proof of learning achievements
    
- **Learn-to-earn rewards:** Transparent and auditable incentives
    
- **Decentralized trust:** No single authority controls learning records
    
- **Sustainable infrastructure:** Low-cost, long-term viability
    

This aligns strongly with Cardano’s focus on **education, identity, and real-world impact**.
