## Team Overview

**MuluCard** is a Cardano-aligned digital identity and credential verification platform designed to help individuals and institutions issue, manage, and verify trusted digital cards and certificates.

The project addresses a critical challenge in Ethiopia and across Africa: fragmented, paper-based, and easily forged identity and credential systems. By leveraging blockchain technology, MuluCard introduces a secure, verifiable, and accessible layer of trust for real-world identity use cases.

## Problem Context

In Ethiopia and many African countries, identity cards, certificates, and access credentials are often paper-based or stored in disconnected systems. This makes verification slow, costly, and vulnerable to fraud.

Institutions struggle to validate authenticity, while individuals lack portable and trusted digital credentials. This limits trust, efficiency, and access to opportunities.

---

## Project Vision

MuluCard envisions a **trusted digital credential ecosystem** where individuals own verifiable identities and institutions can confidently issue and validate credentials without relying on centralized or opaque systems.

---

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano serves as the project’s **trust and verification layer**, enabling:

- Verifiable and tamper-proof digital credentials
    
- Decentralized trust without a single controlling authority
    
- Low-cost, sustainable infrastructure suitable for large-scale adoption
    
- Long-term reliability for public and institutional records
    

This aligns strongly with Cardano’s focus on **digital identity, governance, and real-world adoption**.
