## Problem Context

Event ticketing systems today face several challenges:

- Counterfeit and duplicated tickets
    
- Lack of transparency in ticket sales and transfers
    
- Limited trust between organizers and attendees
    
- Manual or centralized verification processes
    

These issues lead to financial losses, poor user experience, and reduced trust in events.

## Project Vision

The project envisions a **trusted, transparent ticketing ecosystem** where:

- Tickets are verifiable and tamper-proof
    
- Ownership and transfers are transparent
    
- Organizers gain real-time visibility
    
- Attendees trust the authenticity of their tickets

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano acts as the **verification and trust layer**, enabling:

- **Immutable ticket records:** Prevents duplication and forgery
    
- **Transparent ownership:** Verifiable ticket transfers
    
- **Low-cost transactions:** Suitable for high-volume events
    
- **Sustainable infrastructure:** Long-term reliability for event ecosystems
    

This aligns with Cardano’s focus on **real-world applications, transparency, and sustainable systems**.
