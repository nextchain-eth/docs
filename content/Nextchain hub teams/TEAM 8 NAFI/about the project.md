# 🌾 Imani

**NextChain Hub – CATS Hackathon Team Story**

## Team Overview

**Imani** is a Cardano-aligned platform that transforms **verified sustainable farming practices into on-chain reputation**, enabling smallholder farmers to access **green credit, subsidies, and climate-smart financial support**.

The project addresses a core challenge in Africa’s agricultural and green finance ecosystems: while farmers adopt sustainable practices, traditional systems cannot reliably verify them. Imani introduces a **trusted digital verification layer** that connects farmers, financial institutions, governments, and investors through credible, measurable sustainability data.

## Problem Context

Smallholder farmers across Ethiopia and Africa face **limited access to affordable credit and green subsidies**. While many adopt climate-smart and sustainable farming practices, traditional financial and institutional systems **cannot reliably verify these behaviors**.

As a result:

- Farmers remain under-supported
    
- Sustainable practices are not incentivized
    
- Green finance lacks trusted data
    
- Investment and policy decisions are fragmented
    

---

## Project Vision

Imani envisions a **verified, incentive-aligned agricultural ecosystem** where:

- Sustainable farming practices are digitally verified
    
- Farmers build on-chain reputation over time
    
- Green credit and subsidies reach the right beneficiaries
    
- Climate-smart agriculture is measurably rewarded
    

---

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano serves as the **verification and reputation layer** for Imani, enabling:

- **On-chain proof of sustainable practices**
    
- **Farmer reputation linked to verified data**
    
- **Transparent, auditable sustainability records**
    
- **Low-cost, sustainable infrastructure suitable for rural adoption**
    

This aligns strongly with Cardano’s focus on **sustainability, identity, governance, and real-world financial inclusion**.

## Regional Impact

- **Local:** Empowers smallholder farmers with access to green finance
    
- **National:** Integrates farmers into digital monitoring and support systems
    
- **Regional:** Enables collaboration and data sharing across farming communities
    
- **Continental:** Strengthens Africa’s green finance ecosystem with trusted data

## Potential for Change

### **Current State**

Farmers lack access to affordable credit because sustainable practices cannot be reliably verified. Financial support is fragmented, and climate-resilient behavior is not incentivized.

### **Near-Term Potential**

Imani enables farmers to digitally verify sustainable practices, unlocking access to credit and subsidies. Governments and partners gain visibility into climate-smart agriculture, supporting better decisions.

### **End-State Vision**

With broader adoption, Imani supports an interconnected ecosystem where verified practices are rewarded automatically, green finance flows efficiently, and agriculture becomes more resilient, inclusive, and climate-smart.

## Learning & Evolution During the Programme

Initially, the team viewed the challenge as primarily financial—improving access to credit and subsidies. Through the programme, a key insight emerged: **verification is the real bottleneck**.

The team’s focus shifted from financial tools alone to building a **trusted verification system** that aligns incentives across farmers, governments, and investors. This reframing expanded the project’s purpose from subsidy access to **ecosystem-level coordination for green finance**.

The programme revealed how **small, reliable trust layers can unlock large systemic change**, reinforcing the project’s long-term relevance.

## How the Team Is Organised

Imani operates as a **five-person cross-functional team** with clear ownership across architecture, frontend, backend, UX, and visual design.

- Weekly coordination meetings track progress and challenges
    
- Development follows iterative, feedback-driven cycles
    
- Strategic decisions are made collaboratively
    
- Cloud infrastructure ensures scalability and accessibility
    

This structure enables parallel execution while maintaining strong alignment around the project’s sustainability mission.

## Current Status

- Team formed with defined technical and design roles
    
- Core verification and reputation model designed
    
- Cardano and cloud architecture planned
    
- Preparing for prototype deployment and documentation
