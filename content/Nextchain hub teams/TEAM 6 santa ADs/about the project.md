## Problem Context

Digital advertising today suffers from:

- Inflated or manipulated engagement metrics
    
- Ad fraud and bot-driven traffic
    
- Lack of transparency for advertisers
    
- Little to no value returned to real users
    

Advertisers struggle to trust performance data, while users’ attention is monetized without fair compensation.

## Project Vision

Santa Ads envisions a **transparent, trust-based advertising ecosystem** where:

- Advertisers pay for verified attention
    
- Users are rewarded for genuine engagement
    
- Ad performance data is auditable and immutable
    
- Trust replaces opaque intermediaries

## Cardano Alignment

Cardano acts as the **trust and verification layer** for Santa Ads, enabling:

- **Verifiable ad engagement:** Proof of real user interaction
    
- **Immutable performance data:** No post-hoc manipulation
    
- **Watch-to-earn rewards:** Transparent and auditable incentives
    
- **Low-cost & sustainable infrastructure:** Suitable for large-scale use
    

This aligns with Cardano’s focus on **fair systems, data integrity, and sustainable digital economies**.
