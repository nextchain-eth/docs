# Our Story

## NextChain Hub Ethiopia

**CATS26 Action-Learning Journey**

**Addis Ababa, Ethiopia**  
**November 20 – December 20**

---

## Orientation & Shared Baseline

NextChain Hub Ethiopia entered the CATS Action-Learning Journey with an existing and active developer community, shaped by prior ecosystem engagement, including AfroChain and university-based workshops.

From the outset, the programme was framed not as a traditional hackathon, but as a **learning-by-doing journey**, where progress would be demonstrated through participation, documentation, and artefacts rather than ideas alone.

To reach developers across different contexts, the hub began with **three virtual orientation and learning sessions**:

- **November 20** – Virtual session via Cardano Academy channel
    
- **November 25** – Second virtual session via Cardano Academy channel
    
- **December 15** – Virtual session via NextChain Hub Telegram channel
    

These sessions established shared expectations around learning, participation, and project development, and helped onboard developers with varying levels of Web3 experience.

## Local Context & Continuous Engagement

Following AfroChain, the hub leveraged a unique opportunity: **nearly two weeks of continuous university workshops**, which allowed the team to engage with developers **daily**, rather than only through scheduled hackathon sessions.

This daily presence created:

- Repeated touchpoints with developers
    
- Ongoing conversations about Web3 fundamentals
    
- Space for informal mentorship and trust-building
    

Rather than treating learning as a one-off event, the hub operated inside the **existing rhythms of university life**, which proved critical for onboarding beginners and sustaining engagement.

Typical workshop attendance ranged between **15–20 participants per session**, with developers at very early stages of their Web3 journey.

## Learning Spine: Workshops & Virtual Reach

To complement in-person university engagement and reach developers beyond campus environments, the hub deliberately combined **physical and virtual learning spaces**.

- **University workshops** served as the primary environment for team formation and early project ideation
    
- **Virtual meetups** via Cardano Academy and the NextChain Telegram channel extended access to developers outside the universities
    

This hybrid approach ensured inclusion while maintaining a consistent learning narrative across different entry points.

---

## Team Formation & Early Organisation

Most teams emerged organically during the **university workshops**, where developers were already collaborating, learning together, and identifying shared interests.

Team information was collected through:

- In-person coordination during workshops
    
- Direct email submissions
    
- Follow-ups through Telegram
    

Recognizing the need to include developers outside the university context, the hub scheduled an **open in-person meetup on December 20 at Hubbits Workspace**. This session was designed to:

- Welcome developers not reached through universities
    
- Enable late team formation
    
- Provide space for project refinement
    

At the time of documentation, **no new teams had yet formed** through this open meetup pathway, highlighting the strong role universities played as organising anchors.

---

## From Insight to Projects

Despite many participants being **first-time Web3 builders**, several teams successfully formed and articulated project directions grounded in local realities, including:

- Digital identity and employment trust
    
- Sustainable agriculture and green finance
    
- Ticketing and event infrastructure
    
- Education, advertising, and reputation systems
    

These projects reflect a common pattern: **trust gaps in Ethiopian systems** and the need for verifiable, transparent infrastructure.

## Technical Assistance as a Bottleneck

One of the most significant challenges encountered by NextChain Hub Ethiopia was **technical capacity**.

Because a large portion of participants were beginners in Web3 and Cardano:

- Teams required **strong, hands-on technical assistance**
    
- Progress often slowed due to limited access to experienced mentors
    
- Hub leads spent substantial time supporting foundational concepts
    

To address this, the hub formally requested **additional technical support from the WADA team**, recognizing that high-quality projects require sustained mentorship, not just motivation or ideation.

This challenge revealed a key insight: **developer enthusiasm in Ethiopia is high, but structured technical support is essential for conversion into strong implementations**.

---

## Publishing & Documentation in Practice

Throughout the journey, the hub worked to establish:

- A documentation structure for team stories
    
- Deployment of hub-level docs
    
- Collection of project artefacts and narratives
    

While documentation capacity is still maturing, teams began contributing to shared records, and hub leads coordinated the consolidation of team stories into a coherent hub archive.

Publishing is treated not as a final step, but as an **ongoing learning process**, improving with each iteration.

---

## What Emerged

By the end of this phase, several important capabilities had emerged:

- A **repeatable hybrid organising model** combining universities and virtual spaces
    
- Developers beginning to think in terms of **systems, trust, and verification**, not just applications
    
- Teams capable of articulating problems grounded in Ethiopian realities
    
- A clearer understanding of what technical support structures are required for scale
    

Most importantly, the hub demonstrated that **consistent presence, daily engagement, and contextual learning** can mobilise developers more effectively than isolated hackathon events.

---

## Looking Ahead

NextChain Hub Ethiopia now enters the next phase with:

- A core group of active teams
    
- Clear visibility into technical gaps and support needs
    
- Established relationships with developers across universities
    
- A growing publishing and documentation practice
    

The focus moving forward is on **deepening technical execution**, strengthening mentorship pathways, and continuing to translate local insight into credible, verifiable digital infrastructure.
