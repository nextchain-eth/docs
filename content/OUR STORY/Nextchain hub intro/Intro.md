# NextChain Hub Ethiopia

**CATS 2026 Action-Learning Journey**

**Location:** Addis Ababa, Ethiopia  
**Period:** November – December 2025  
**Programme:** Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS) 2026

## Overview

NextChain Hub Ethiopia is a local coordination hub participating in the CATS 2026 action-learning journey. The hub brings together developers, students, and early-stage builders to explore how Cardano-based technologies can respond to real, locally grounded challenges.

Rather than operating as a one-off hackathon, the hub was organised as a continuous learning process rooted in repeated engagement, in-person interaction, and visible documentation. Our focus has been on building learning momentum, supporting team formation, and making progress traceable through shared publishing.

## Our Context

Ethiopia has a rapidly growing developer community and strong interest in blockchain, accelerated by ecosystem events such as AfroChain. However, many developers are still at an early stage of their Web3 journey and benefit most from sustained guidance rather than short, competitive-only formats.

NextChain Hub Ethiopia operates at the intersection of:

- University-based developer communities
    
- Independent builders and early professionals
    
- Regional Cardano and CATS-aligned initiatives
    

This context shaped our approach: prioritising continuity, physical presence, and learning support over speed or scale.

## Early Engagement & Orientation

Our first in-person university workshops were held on **November 5 and November 8**, where we introduced CATS 2026, explained the hackathon structure, and walked participants through expectations, learning paths, and participation requirements.

These sessions played a critical role in:

- Setting a shared understanding of the programme as an action-learning journey
    
- Onboarding first-time Web3 developers
    
- Creating early awareness that later enabled smoother team formation
    

To support accessibility and self-paced learning, we also shared **Amharic-language Cardano development resources**, including curated YouTube content from Cardano Academy, ensuring local-language support for developers new to the ecosystem.

## How We Organised

Our organising strategy focused on **cadence over concentration**.

Following AfroChain, we ran nearly two weeks of in-person university workshops, meeting developers almost daily. This created repeated contact points that helped build trust, clarify concepts, and allow collaboration to emerge naturally.

To extend reach beyond universities, we hosted three virtual meetups:

- **Nov 20 & Nov 25** via Cardano Academy channels
    
- **Dec 15** via the NextChain Telegram community
    

While virtual sessions expanded visibility, most teams ultimately formed through in-person workshops, reinforcing the importance of physical presence in early-stage ecosystem building.

## Documentation as Infrastructure

From the beginning, documentation was treated as core infrastructure rather than a post-event task.

This docs space serves as:

- A shared memory of workshops, sessions, and decisions
    
- A coordination surface for teams and organisers
    
- A publishing layer for evaluators and the wider CATS ecosystem
    

By documenting learning, team formation, and progress as they happened, we ensured that effort and insight remained visible and traceable over time.

## What Emerged

Several clear patterns emerged through this process:

- In-person engagement accelerated trust and team formation
    
- Motivation and contextual relevance were strong
    
- **Technical assistance** emerged as the primary constraint, as many participants were beginners to Web3 and Cardano
    

This insight directly informed our focus on requesting deeper technical mentorship and structured support from the wider CATS and WADA ecosystem.
